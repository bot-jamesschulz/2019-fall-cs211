Milestone 7 was the most frustrating experience I have had with programming to date. I have never struggled so much and ultimately failed
to solve my problems. This is the first time that I have given up on a programming assignment because I could not figure out my problems. I
think that a lot of my frustration comes from the messiness that came from the text editor. This being my first project that spanned more
than one assignment I have learned so many things that I will make sure I never repeat on my next project. The mess that comes from a
semester’s worth of code is demoralizing when you are trying to work through a new problem but repeatedly get lost in your two-month-old
code that hasn’t been properly archived. Even with comments on every block of code explaining what it does it still takes far too long to
figure out what is going on when everything is written on one continuous page. 
I spent more than half a dozen hours just trying to figure out ways of getting my file into a position to where it would be easier to sort.
I think a large part of this goes back the beginning of the semester again. When I was designing elements for the first milestones I had no
idea what I should be designing for in the future, and even if I did I wouldn’t have known how to. Every time I wanted to implement some
functionality to move the text to a position that I could sort it in, I would encounter issues that would affect the rest of the program.
Even if I could have manipulated my file so that I could sort it, I don’t even think I would have been able to figure out how to sort 
strings with insertion, bubble, etc.
